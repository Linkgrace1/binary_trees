0x1D. C - Binary trees

In this project, I went solo to stretch my brain a little more when I could't get a serious partner. I learnt  about the details, advantages, disadvantages of using  trees and data structures.

I learnt how to qualify trees and also how to traverse them. Throughout the project, I implemented binary, binary search, AVL and Max Binary Heap trees.
